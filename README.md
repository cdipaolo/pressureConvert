#Basic Pressure Converter
##Implemented in wxPython and Python 2.7

This was made for Google Code-In 2014

#Usage
###Entering Digits
Once the application is running, enter the units you want to convert from in the from column.
###Process Conversion
Hit return to convert to the new unit.
###Change To/From Units
Click on the "From ___" or "To ___" buttons and select the unit you want to convert too


#Room For Improvement:
-Cut extensive usage of global variables

-Improve UI -although that is challenging with the limitations of wxPython :)

-Be responsive to user input without having to hit enter

-Change to use more accurate conversion factors
